# What is Retro Music Library
Pure Basic includes for playing old retro music, is the basic core functionality to audibly hear retro music, its a library of as many as I can making plug-ins for.

# What it is not?
let me be very clear and also controdic myself, RML is not and will not -ever- be a GUI player and I will condem anyone that use it to do so directly, because we have damn ably enough of them already.

# No gui player then?
No, remember I said I'd controdic myself? yes but not in this project githib page, when or if I make one for DEBUGGING PURPOSES ONLY that will be it's own thing separate from this one.
